The icons used for the action menu bar at the top of my main activity were gotten from:

https://design.google.com/icons/ 

which is a free open source website which provides material icons. These icons are available under the CC-BY license. 
These icons are available as long as I don't re-sell them.

The icons used for the splash application at the start of the app and app icon were gotten from:

https://icons8.com/

which is also a free open source website provided icons aren't re-sold as well.

For setting up the android project and retrieving music from the device:

http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/create-a-music-player-on-android-project-setup--mobile-22764

was used. It allowed me to understand the structure that my app would take letting me dynamically create the other parts
required to play audio and handle creation, banding or unbinding the music service.
